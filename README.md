## Overview
A **USB isolator** is a device that protects connected USB peripherals and host systems from electrical noise, ground loops, and potential damage caused by voltage spikes. It acts as a barrier between the USB host (computer, microcontroller, or industrial system) and the connected USB device (sensor, keyboard, mouse, storage, etc.), ensuring clean signal transmission and enhanced reliability.

Whether you're working with sensitive medical equipment, industrial automation, or audio interfaces, a USB isolator can be invaluable in improving signal integrity and safeguarding hardware.

## Installation
1. **Connect to the Host:** Plug the USB isolator into an available USB port on your computer or embedded system.
2. **Attach the Peripheral:** Connect your USB device (sensor, keyboard, DAC, etc.) to the other end of the isolator.
3. **Power Management:** If the device requires external power, ensure it is properly connected.
4. **Verify Operation:** Check that the device is recognized by the host and functioning correctly.
5. **Enjoy a Clean Signal Path:** Your USB connection is now isolated, reducing noise and protecting against electrical issues.
